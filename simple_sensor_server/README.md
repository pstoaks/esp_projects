# The Simple ESP8266 Sensor Server

## Overview
Note: This is not yet complete.  I will be completing it in the coming week or so.

This is a very simple ESP8266 Arduino sketch that is written for the NodeMCU
and a few inexpensive, readily available sensors as an introduction to this
powerful, WiFi enabled microcontroller platform.

## What's needed:
* An ESP8266 development board: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/V3-Wireless-module-NodeMcu-4M-bytes-Lua-WIFI-Internet-of-Things-development-board-based-ESP8266-ESP/32801590957.html
* A breadboard is nice:  https://www.aliexpress.com/item/15982-Free-shipping-MB102-830-Point-Solderless-PCB-Breadboard-with-65pcs-Jump-Cable-Wires-and-Power/32359686534.html
